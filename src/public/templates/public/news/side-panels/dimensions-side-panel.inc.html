        Four dimensions of data maturity
      </span>
    </h1>
    <p class="dmb-u-m-b-m">
      We measure data maturity across four different dimensions. Enabling advanced capabilities across these dimensions helps set leaders apart from the rest and gives them a disproportionate ability to drive value with their audience data. Based on your strategic choices, not all of the dimensions may be applicable to your organization.
