section_project_desc@: The Girls in the Magnesium Dress is an innovative chamber music collaboration between double bass and harp. Named after one of the most renowned orchestral pieces by Frank Zappa, the ensemble involves the audience in a new musical experience led by Valentina Scheldhofen Ciardelli and Anna Astesano. Their versatile repertoire appeals to a wide public with sparkling transcriptions from the opera world, virtuoso repertoire and 21st century music, reversing the stereotypes surrounding both instruments. The duo collaborates with established composers such as John Alexander, Paul Patterson and Kurt Morgan. The Girls have performed in several important London venues such as St- Martin-in-the-Fields, Wigmore Hall, Greenwich Theatre, St. James Piccadilly Church, Trinity Church, the GSM Auditorium, Sala dell’Affresco and Chiesa di S. Micheletto in Lucca.
